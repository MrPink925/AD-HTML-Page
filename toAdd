functionality for copy to another user

copy data to existing user should only copy the member of groups.
possible checkbox  for copy member of groups and description,office, job, etc
not necessary^ 

make default functionality to copy to existing user  rather than net new

upon box tick, show second username textbox, and another 
checkbox "net new user"

if "net new user" box not checked, but second user does not 
exist, prompt user that user does not exist 


add third box for overwrite member of groups or append member of groups
